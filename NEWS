libgeo-ipfree-perl (0.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  0.2-7 contains an updated country data file which is more detailed and more
  accurate than the previous one. There's only one caveat:

  Versions before 0.2-7 returned
    I0: 10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255
    L0: 127.0.0.0 127.255.255.255
    I0: 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255

  Since 0.2-7 "ZZ" is returned for these address ranges (and for 39 other
  reserved address spaces).

  If your application relies on I0 or L0 please make sure to change it to ZZ.
